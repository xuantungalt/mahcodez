Re-install the Arduino Pro Mini Bootloader using my Arduino Uno as an ISP Programmer!

To resolve the errors I burned the bootloader to the Arduino Pro Minis using my functioning Arduino Uno as an ISP. For the most part I followed the instructions here: http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/247 adhering to Option 1 but using the Arduino IDE to burn the bootloader. Here is what I did step by step:
1. Connect the Arduino Uno via USB to the PC
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Select the correct COM port and board (Arduino Uno)
4. Open the ArduinoISP sketch (File>Examples>ArduinoISP)
5. Upload the sketch. once complete your Arduino Uno is now programmed to be an ISP programmer. This is great because I really didn't want to buy a separate programmer.
6. Power the Uno off and wire the Uno to the Arduino Pro Mini in the following fashion:

                 Uno=Pro Mini           or             Mega=Pro Mini
                  5v=VCC                                 5v=vcc
                 GND=GND                                Gnd=GND
Digital Pin 11(MOSI)=Pin 11 (MOSI)                   pin 51=pin 11
Digital Pin 12(MISO)=Pin 12 (MISO)                   pin 50=pin 12
 Digital Pin 13(SCK)=Pin 13 (SCK)                    pin 52=pin 13
      Digital Pin 10=RST                             pin 53=reset

7. Power on the Uno
8. Select the correct COM port
9. IMPORTANT: Select board Arduino Pro Mini 5v w/ATmega328 as the board we are uploading to
10.from the Tools menu, select Burn Bootloader > w/Aduino as ISP


after you have bootloader installed, to then upload sketches onto the  pro mini clone you need to rewire the connections as follows

Step 1.
Connect jumpers as follows
Arduino UNO/mega -- pro mini
         RESET   --   GND Connect reset to ground on the Uno or Mega 
         RX      --   RXD
         TX      --   TXD
         5 V     --   VCC
         GND     --   GND


and yes RX goes to RX and TX to TX for sure 

Step 2.
Plug the arduino into the USB lead as normal

Step 3.
Arduino IDE > Tools > Board > Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (5V, 16MHz) w/ ATmega328

Step 4.
Load/Type your sketch into the IDE

Step 5.
Click the Upload Icon or Arduino IDE > File > Upload

Step 6.
When the sketch size show in the debug panel (The bottom of the IDE)
Tap the reset button on the Pro Mini - This starts the bootloader.
if you get error "avrdude: stk500_getsync(): not in sync: resp=0x00"
practice your timing with clicking reset button after seeing "Binary sketch size: 3.772 bytes (of a 30.720 byte maximum)"


If there are any error messages - Double check the wiring, The most common cause of error is 
connecting the Rx and Tx lines back to front.
