Step 1 : Create the Image file
Use “dd” to create the 512Mb file as given below.
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.img bs=1024 count=524288
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=1MB count=512
How much is 512MB?
512MB => 512*1024 = 524288

Step 2 : Test the image file
$ fdisk test.img -lu
Disk test.img doesn’t contain a valid partition table since we haven’t created one yet.

Step 3 : Create a partition
For creating a partition table using fdisk in the image, we have to set the following settings.

1. Set cylinder number , based on image size we have created.
2. Create partition

$ fdisk -u test.img
Command (m for help): p
Command (m for help): x
Expert command (m for help): c
Number of cylinders (1-1048576): NOC (from above equation) # no. of cylinders (NOC) = (size of the image in bytes / (255*63))
Command (m for help): w

Step 4 : Loop mount the partition and format it as EXT3
$ losetup –offset 63*512 /dev/loop0 test.img
$ mkfs.ext3 /dev/loop0

Step 5 : Umount the loop device
$ losetup -d /dev/loop0
